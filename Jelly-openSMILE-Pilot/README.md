## About

openSMILE is a complete and open-source toolkit for audio analysis, processing and classification especially targeted at speech and music applications, e.g. ASR, emotion recognition, or beat tracking and chord detection.
The toolkit was developed at the Institute for Human-Machine Communication at the Technische Universitaet Muenchen in Munich, Germany and is now maintained
and developed further by audEERING UG (limited). 
It was started initally for the SEMAINE EU FP7 project.


## Third-party dependencies

openSMILE uses LibSVM (by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin) for classification tasks. It is distributed with openSMILE and is included in the svm/ directory.

PortAudio is required for live recording from sound card and for the SEMAINE component.
You can get it from: http://www.portaudio.com
A working snapshot is included in thirdparty/portaudio.tgz

Optionally, openSMILE can be linked against the SEMAINE API and the Julius LVCSR engine, enabling an interface to the SEMAINE system and a keyword spotter component. See http://www.semaine-project.eu/ for details on running the SEMAINE system. Note, that the SEMAINE API is only offically supported until Version 1.0.1 (the last GPL release), but nobody will complain if you link openSMILE 2.x against the SEMAINE API for your private or educational use.


## Documentation/Installing/Using

openSMILE is well documented in the openSMILE book, which can be 
found in doc/openSMILE_book.pdf.

For quick-start information on how to compile openSMILE, see the file INSTALL.

## Developers

Incomplete developer's documentation can be found in "doc/developer" 
and in the openSMILE book.

Information on how to write and compile run-time linkable plug-ins 
for openSMILE, see the openSMILE book or take a look at the files 
in the "plugindev" directory, especially the README file.
